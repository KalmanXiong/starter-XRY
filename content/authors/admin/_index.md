I was a software engineer for 6 years. At that time, I was responsible for framework design and team management as a group leader. My active areas of work are computer vision, SLAM and autonomous cleaning robots. My favorite programming languages ​​are C++ and python. 

When I worked at MYNT AI, I guided a group to develop the [SDK](https://github.com/slightech/MYNT-EYE-S-SDK) for a kind of binocular vision camera:[MYNTEYE](https://www.mynteye.com/products/mynt-eye-stereo-camera). Before we accomplished the project, researchers or engineers who were interested in SLAM, had limited options for the binocular cameras in China or cannot get too much support from the manufacturers. But when we brought this product to the market, it was a huge success. Most of the people in the field bought our product and even built close operations with us. At that time our partners were: Alibaba, Meituan, JD, SF Express, Shentong, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University. During this tenure, I was granted a patent for an invention.

Then I joined INDEMIND, a company specializing in visual and indoor navigation. At that time, as the team leader of the software SDK, I participated in the research and development of large-scale intelligent sweepers. Our partners are giants in cleaning equipment. Before I left to study in the United States, I led the team to complete the second-phase verification of the project, which was greatly appreciated and additionally invested by the partner.

I am currently doing some machine learning and data analysis work in a laboratory at UF. The current main research topic is to use the GPS data of escape personnel to analyze their escape routes, route selection, and the rationality of urban road distribution during the Sonoma wildfire in 2019. This project is supported by the California government.
